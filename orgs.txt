Our main vision is to advo3for a provision of relevant context caring for children, women and those who cannot advocate for themselves. This organization was started after seeing the growing number of children placed placed in children homes. Three members did analysis on what is the issue and out of that discussion it was clear that the core problem is misbehaving in families which is caused by lack of sustainable values. 	The organization is working closely with traditional leaders and other stakeholders advocating for relevant context that minimizes the abuse in women and children. The strategy that we use is formation of forums e. G Women, men, children and senior citizen forums where individuals get a chance to discuss issues that affect them directly and those issues are taken into consideration and the relevant stakeholders get to intervene and progress monitored by all stakeholders through war rooms that are held once a month. Fighting of poverty through empowering and encouraging family members to use the skills that they possess in order for them to fight to fight poverty. 	"GabrielFoundation2013@gmail.com.
